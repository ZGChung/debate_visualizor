Lincoln: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Douglas: The question is simply this: Shall the people of a United States Territory, like the people of a State, have the right to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way?
Lincoln: I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided.
Douglas: Let each State mind its own business and let its neighbors alone. If we will only act on that great principle, we will go on peaceably, happily and prosperously.
Lincoln: A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.
Douglas: The great principle of self-government is at stake, and surely the people of this country are never going to decide that the principle upon which our whole republican system rests is vicious and wrong.
Lincoln: What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence? It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army.
Douglas: The right of the people to govern themselves is the fundamental principle upon which our whole system of government rests.
Lincoln: The ballot is stronger than the bullet.
Douglas: Popular sovereignty is the great principle upon which our institutions rest.
